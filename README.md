# Nishani8
This code was written specifically for Al-Jamea students.
It allows a student to automatically open their textbooks and/or relevant websites by taking input from 3 spreadsheets.

Kitab_Database stores textbooks and corresponding textbook links or textbook pdf paths.
Schedule stores the schedule information of a class, which can be modified as schedules are subject to change.
Nishani stores the previous page number, notes, and questions for each subject, which are extracted from this spreadsheet next time the subject appears in the schedule.
IF ANY OF THESE SPREADSHEETS ARE RENAMED OR MOVED TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION, THIS PROGRAM WILL FAIL.

This program uses the date provided by the computer to automatically access the pertaining day's schedule.
THIS CODE WILL NOT WORK ON SUNDAYS.
FOR NORTH AMERICAN USERS, THIS CODE WILL NOT WORK UNLESS DATE IS MATCHED TO YOUR CAMPUS.

Instructions for usage:
The user MUST have installed either Chocolatey (for Windows) or HomeBrew (for MacOS) to proceed.
